An empoloyee can work for one branch at a time, and each branch will be managed by one of the employees that work there. We'll also want to keep track of when the current manager started as manager.

A branch may handle a number of clients, with each client having a name and a unique number to identify it. A single client may only be handled by one branch at a time.

Employees can work with clients controlled by thier branch to sell them stuff. If necessary multiple empolyees can work with the same client. We'll want to keep track of how many dollars worth of stuff each employee sells to each client they work with.

Many branches will need to work with suppliers to buy inventory. For each supplier we'll keep track of thier name and thetype of product they're selling that branch. A single supplier may supply products to multiple branches.
